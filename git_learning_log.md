## Authentication Issue and Resolution

### Problem
After installing GitHub CLI and authenticating, the terminal "forgot" the login information when reopened.

### Solution
1. We verified the authentication status using:
   ```
   gh auth status
   ```
2. If not logged in, we reauthenticated using:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

### Git User Configuration
We set up Git user information globally:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## Basic Git and GitHub CLI Commands

1. Create a new repository:
   ```
   gh repo create practice-repo --public
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/practice-repo.git
   cd practice-repo
   ```

3. Create and add a file:
   ```
   echo "# Practice Repository" > README.md
   git add README.md
   ```

4. Commit changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Added README file"
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

6. View repository information:
   ```
   gh repo view
   ```

7. List repositories:
   ```
   gh repo list
   ```

8. Create an issue:
   ```
   gh issue create --title "My first issue" --body "This is a test issue created using GitHub CLI"
   ```

9. List issues:
   ```
   gh issue list
   ```

10. Create a new branch and make changes:
    ```
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    echo "This is a new line" >> README.md
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Update README.md"
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```

11. Create a pull request:
    ```
    gh pr create --title "Update README" --body "Added a new line to README.md"
    ```

12. List pull requests:
    ```
    gh pr list
    ```

## Platform-Specific Commands

### Creating Files

1. On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):
   ```
   touch filename.txt
   ```

2. On Windows:
   ```
   echo. > filename.txt
   ```
   Note: This creates an empty file. To add content directly from the command line:
   ```
   echo Some content > filename.txt
   ```

Remember to use platform-appropriate commands when following Git tutorials or guides.

## Understanding Git Branches

### Analogy 1: The Book Writing Process

Imagine you're writing a book. The main story is your 'main' branch. Now, you want to experiment with a different plot twist:

- You don't want to change your original story just yet, so you make a photocopy of your manuscript. This is like creating a new branch.
- You write your new idea on this copy. This is like committing changes to your new branch.
- If you like the new plot twist, you can incorporate it back into your original manuscript. This is like merging the branch.
- If you don't like it, you can simply discard the photocopy. No harm done to your original story!

### Analogy 2: The Parallel Universes

Think of your project as a timeline, and branches as parallel universes:

- The main branch is the primary timeline.
- When you create a new branch, you're creating a parallel universe that's identical to the main timeline up to that point.
- In this new universe (branch), you can make changes without affecting the main timeline.
- If the changes in the parallel universe work well, you can merge them back into the main timeline.
- If they don't work out, you can simply stop working on that universe (branch) without affecting the main timeline.

### Analogy 3: The Road Trip

Imagine you're on a road trip:

- The main road you're traveling on is your 'main' branch.
- You see a interesting side road and decide to explore it. This is like creating a new branch.
- You drive down this side road, making stops (commits) along the way.
- If you find something great, you can rejoin the main road (merge your branch).
- If the side road doesn't lead anywhere interesting, you can simply turn back and return to the main road, as if you never left.

### In Practice

In Git, you can create a new branch with:
```
git branch new-feature
```

Switch to the new branch:
```
git checkout new-feature
```

Or create and switch in one command:
```
git checkout -b new-feature
```

Make changes, commit them, and when ready, merge back to main:
```
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

Branches allow you to experiment, develop features, or fix bugs in isolation, without risking the stability of your main codebase. They're a fundamental feature that makes Git powerful for collaboration and managing complex projects.
